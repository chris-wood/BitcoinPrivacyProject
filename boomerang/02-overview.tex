\section{Boomerang Overview}
At its heart, Boomerang is a peer-to-peer mixnet that can be leveraged by any anonymizing coin, such as Zerocoin, to provide network-layer anonymity analogous to Tor without the same side channel vulnerabilities. The main idea is to hide the source or origin from which transactions are introduced into the network.
