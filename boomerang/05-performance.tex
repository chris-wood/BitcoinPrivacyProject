\section{Performance Analysis}
TODO: from the simulation

% 1. average time between transaction creation and final broadcast bounded by what?
% 2. average bandwidth consumption by node (based on generation rate)

\subsection{Parameter Selection}

% TODO: discuss parameter selection from below

% cover traffic generation rate (random variable)
% mix buffer delay (random variable)
% circuit length (fixed)
% mix buffer size (fixed)
% encoded transaction size
