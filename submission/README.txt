---------------------------------

As per our project proposal, this submission package is structured into two sections as follows. One part is for our literature survey on Bitcoin anonymity, and the other part is for our Tarzan- and Tor-inspired mixnet idea for Bitcoin - Boomerang. The Boomerang directory contains a writeup describing our idea, anonymity analysis, and performance implications, as well as the discrete-time simulator we developed to assess its performance. Instructions for compiling and running the simulator with a particular network configuration are contained in the BitcoinBoomerang.pdf document.
