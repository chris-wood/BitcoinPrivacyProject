TODO: identify issues in the bitcoin protocol that need to be addressed, and propose some solutions here

- downside: mixing services help break the link from transaction graph, but compromised services can still lead to leaking information about client inputs and client outputs (engineering limitation)
- plusside: can be built using existing protocol
- plusside: Zerocoin doesnt suffer from that implementation problem
- downside: not supported, needs to be a new form of cryptocurrency, or use Bitcoin or something else as backing currency 
- downside: computationlal complexity and increased liklihood of error

\begin{itemize}
	\item need to unlink transactions from users - this is an inherent problem that comes with the block chain
	\item transaction graph essentially serves as a means for people to check whether or not the funds for an address were at some point transferred to that address -> this is why ZK proofs as digital committments and accumulators are such an intuitive solution
\end{itemize}
